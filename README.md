Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Network

# Abstract
The aim of this project is that we are designing a web-based application that will predict the prices of the stock and tell us which stocks are at all time high or all time low according to the various charts by analyzing them according to the previous trends. We are using the concept of machine learning by importing different types of modules and libraries for analyzing the chart and the prices. We are adding this feature like if we want to know the current status like according to past years, months or days the live trend in their charts or prices we simply have to type the name of the stocks ; give the date from which we want to fetch the information and all the things like all the formats it will tell like 24H LOW-HIGH ,CHART TREND AND PRICES by analyzing the previous trends. We are making this web app using jupyter notebook and by importing libraries of python.

# UNDERSTANDING PROBLEM STATEMENT
We’ll dive into the implementation part of this Project soon, but first it’s important to establish what we’re aiming to solve. Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.

● Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.

● Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.

As you might have guessed, our focus will be on the technical analysis and visualization part. We’ll be using a dataset from Yahoo stock Price test and train. forecasting the price of a stock is comparatively easier than predicting a stock price, which is much more difficult. For prediction, the model needs to have multiple inputs. This can include major political and economic events and assessing their impact on the stock price. Also, aspects that are tough to capture, such as the market’s mood, psychology, and herd mentality, need to be quantified and fed to the model. If the user can do so, then for sure, the model can predict the stock price. The reason is that even when the components involved for successfully predicting the stock value range from physical to psychological, driven by human motives that can often be irrational, there are still patterns that the Machine Learning model can capture. What needs to be understood is that the volatility in the market is because stock prices are solely influenced by humans (it’s a market, after all), and humans are often unpredictable and irrational. Still, their unpredictability and irrationality also have patterns that a machine learning model can capture. Suppose the country’s president where the stock is being traded is pro-free market and loses the election. In that case, people can panic and sell stocks leading to a sudden drop in the price, whereas if another anti-capitalist president loses, the market will react oppositely, and the stock prices can shoot up. Common aspects of Fundamental Research includes analyzing and capturing the following: • Market Capital: Market value of a company. (share price * No. Of share outstanding) • P/E (Price/Earnings) Ratio: You must have heard some financial pundits saying that the recent skyrocketing of Tesla stock price is unsustainable as the company is being overvalued. Such a calculation is done by calculating the P/E ratio which is the ratio of a company’s share price to the company’s earnings per share. To put it simply, it explains if the stocks of the company are overbought or oversold.

• Dividend: When you buy a share, you literally have a share in the company i.e. you own the company. And when the company makes a profit, they distribute the profit among its shareholder. This is what is called a dividend.

• Deliverables: This is simply for how long people keep the stock. If they keep it for long then this indicates that the stock prices are stable and people do buy it for long-term investment.

• Net Profit/Loss: This is the total profit or loss the company has made in a financial year

• Net Sales: Its the total sales of a company in a financial year

• Total Debt: It is the amount of debt that the company has on its balance sheet. A stock price of a company can drop significantly if there is negative news regarding the company where the debt is high and assets are low to pay off the debt.

• Total Asset: It is the total value of the asses the company owns. As mentioned above, this can impact the stock price.

• Profit Before Tax / Profit After Tax: This is the total profit company has made before and after paying tax in a financial year.

• Various other Results published by the company: This is where the data scientist has to look into the Balance sheet and Income statement of the company and feed as much useful information to the model as possible allowing the machine learning model to make an informed decision regarding the price of the stock.
